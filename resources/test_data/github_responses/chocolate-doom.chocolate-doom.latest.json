  "body": "  Chocolate Doom 3.0 is a new major revision. The main change is that\r\n  the codebase has been ported to SDL 2.0. This brings a number of\r\n  benefits, although there have also been some other minor changes (all\r\n  listed below).\r\n\r\n  Huge thanks go to the entire Chocolate Doom team for working on the\r\n  port to SDL2, and to all the testers who have found and reported bugs\r\n  during its development.\r\n\r\n### General\r\n  * All screen scaling is now performed in hardware, meaning that the\r\n    game can run in arbitrary window sizes in high quality. It can also\r\n    scale to very large resolutions sizes without using large amounts of\r\n    CPU or suffering degraded performance (thanks Fabian).\r\n  * It is now possible to switch between windowed and full screen modes\r\n    while the game is running by pressing alt + enter (thanks Jon)\r\n  * Windows binaries now ship with several previously-optional DLLs.\r\n    This means it is now possible to take PNG screenshots and to use\r\n    digital music packs (FLAC/Ogg Vorbis formats).\r\n  * The game now remembers your preferred monitor and will start on the\r\n    same monitor you were using the last time you played. Windows appear\r\n    centered on the screen.\r\n  * The OS X launcher was tweaked somewhat, and now uses proper path\r\n    controls for choosing files. FreeDM was added as an IWAD.\r\n  * Configuration files on Mac OS X and Unix are now stored in locations\r\n    compliant with the XDG standard (thanks chungy):\r\n    - On Unix: `~/.local/share/chocolate-doom/`\r\n    - On OS X: `~/Library/Application Support/chocolate-doom/`\r\n  * Icons when the game is running are now a higher resolution.\r\n  * Keyboard input is improved and uses the new SDL input API; on\r\n    systems with on-screen keyboards, this should activate the on-screen\r\n    keyboard when it is appropriate.\r\n  * Menu navigation with the joystick is now much more practical, and\r\n    it's possible to bind a joystick axis to look up/down in games which\r\n    support it (thanks Jon, Wintermute0110).\r\n  * Several command line options were removed that were judged to be\r\n    useless: `-grabmouse`, `-novert` and `-nonovert`. The mouse grabbing\r\n    and novert settings can still be configured in the setup tool.\r\n  * There is no longer any option in the setup tool to specify a screen\r\n    resolution, since in full screen mode the game just runs at the\r\n    desktop resolution without changing screen modes. If necessary, the\r\n    config file options `fullscreen_width` and `fullscreen_height` can\r\n    be used to explicitly set a screen resolution.\r\n  * There is no longer a soft dependency on Zenity on Unix systems; the\r\n    SDL API is now used to display error dialogs.\r\n  * Joysticks are identified more precisely using GUID now.\r\n  * A new parameter, `-savedir` allows users to specify a directory from\r\n    which to load and save games. (thanks CapnClever)\r\n  * The midiproc code from Eternity Engine has been imported, improving\r\n    native MIDI playback on Windows and fixing a long-standing bug with\r\n    music volume adjustment (thanks AlexMax, Quasar).\r\n  * VGA \"porch\" emulation was added (thanks Jon).\r\n  * The codebase now compiles with OpenWatcom (thanks Stephen Finniss).\r\n\r\n### Doom\r\n  * The GOG install of Doom 3: BFG Edition is now detected (thanks chungy)\r\n  * A `-shorttics` command line parameter was added that simulates\r\n    recording a vanilla demo without actually recording a demo.\r\n\r\n### Hexen\r\n  * The CD audio option for music playback has been removed; the CD\r\n    playback API has been removed from SDL 2.0. However, it is possible\r\n    to use digital music packs as an alternative.\r\n\r\n### Strife\r\n  * `voices.wad` is now correctly loaded before PWADs (thanks\r\n    @Catoptromancy)\r\n\r\n### libtextscreen\r\n  * On OS X on machines with retina displays, text screens are rendered\r\n    using a high detail font.\r\n  * File selector widgets now look more visually distinctive.\r\n  * There is now a convenience widget for conditionally hiding widgets.\r\n  * Font handling was restructured to be based around PNG format fonts\r\n    which are converted during the build and can be more easily edited.\r\n  * Handling of code pages was cleaned up, so it is easier to change the\r\n    code to work with a different code page now.\r\n  * Lots of the UI code was changed to use UTF-8 strings.\r\n  * File extensions when using the Zenity file selector are now case\r\n    insensitive (thanks Jon).\r\n"
