  "body": "- fixed MOD playback with DUMB 2.x\r\n- added TNTCLxx cheat, e.g. TNTCL04 sets complevel 4 (Final DOOM)\r\n- draw crosshair before messages, draw crosshair for fist/chainsaw and during on-screen messages\r\n- fixed crosshair locking on target for melee weapons\r\n- more consistently check for ammo instead of weapon type\r\n- fixed odd strafe values (vanilla allows even values only)\r\n- added TNTSHORT cheat to toggle shorttics on and off while in game\r\n- fixed typo in ZDoom-style Actor name (Slalagtite -> Stalagtite)\r\n- fixed Windows Alt-Tab\r\n- fixed a memory leak on SDL_Quit()\r\n- preserve automap position/scale when toggling overlay mode\r\n- allow binding weapon selection to mouse buttons\r\n- add a `-pistolstart` command-line parameter\r\n- fixed crashes on WADs with empty music lumps, e.g. Nihility.wad\r\n- enabled loading 16 bit RIFF wavs in WADs\r\n- make low-pass sound filter (introduced by the previous change) optional\r\n- if executable directory appears not writable, fall back to `.`\r\n- made pitch-shift range independent of target samplerate\r\n- fixed bogus condition preventing automap lines from being drawn\r\n- fixed saving of mouse button bindings\r\n- fixed interpolated z-coordinate after teleporting\r\n- added a new option \"Disable sound cutoffs\" to allow removed map objects to finish playing their sounds and to make seesounds uninterruptible\r\n- allow deleting savegames from menu\r\n- fixed automap crash when `USE_VERTEX_ARRAYS` and `GL_VBO` are undefined\r\n- fluidsynth: reset all controllers when looping a song\r\n- fixed hanging notes on exit when using Portmidi\r\n- show current and next levels when typing IDCLEV cheat\r\n- added a config key for \"exclusive\" i.e. mode-changing fullscreen\r\n- UMAPINFO: if interbackdrop does not specify a valid flat, draw it as a patch instead\r\n- appended revision tracker to UMAPINFO spec document\r\n- ALSA sequencer API backend for ALSA MIDI support (Linux only)\r\n- extended range of maps reachable via `-warp` and IDCLEV:\r\n   * from E1M1-E4M9 to E1M0-E9M99 for D1\r\n   * from MAP01-MAP33 to MAP00-MAP99\r\n   * Limitations:\r\n     * E0My doesn't work, since episode must always be > 0\r\n     * `-warp x 0`, because zero passed to `-warp` as map number is used to warping to first changed map in PWAD\r\n- evaluate mouse motion only once per tick\r\n- show Time/STS widgets above status bar\r\n- removed lowpass-filter item from menu\r\n- fixed `P_SetMobjState()` stack, fixes crash on mayhem18p.wad/m18p31-1509.lmp\r\n- fixed crash in automap on certain maps (e.g. Sunlust MAP01) when using GL renderer, Thing Appearance = Icons and 2xIDDT\r\n- fixed menu intermission desync\r\n- fixed crash when leaving menu in Chex Quest\r\n- initialize the map title widget with the generic map lump name\r\n- make \"Next Level\" key simply increase map number if already outside regular level transition range\r\n- check for next level in IDCLEV cheat before announcing it\r\n- make sure \"Next Level\" key never warps to a non-existent map\r\n- reformatted umapinfo.txt so that it is easier to read in plaintext\r\n- fixed custom episode select for Doom 2\r\n- fixed shifting automap markers\r\n- allow translucent sprites on all complevels\r\n- allow disabling predefined translucency on all complevels\r\n- fixed flood HOM on certain maps (e.g. Plutonia MAP11, HR MAP01) (GL)\r\n- fixed sky walls for cases with sky vs. sky toptextures (e.g. E4M6) (GL)\r\n- fixed transparent spites being rendered incorrectly with transparent walls in view (GL)\r\n- generate a default save-slot name when saving to an empty slot\r\n- added mouse button binds for turn left/right\r\n- fixed sky scaling for non-standard sky sizes, e.g. Eviternity and Ancient Aliens (GL)\r\n- added new advanced HUD layout by Fireb3rt+\r\n- added slice_samplecount config option\r\n- added manifest to declare app as DPI aware, so that Windows will not apply DPI virtualization\r\n- added support for widescreen assets\r\n- added ZDoom's names for the new Crispy Doom/DEHEXTRA things to ActorNames[], so they can be used with BossAction() if needed\r\n- fixed UMAPINFO music restarting issue\r\n- skip the 'entering level' screen if one of endgame, endpic, endbunny or endcast is set (UMAPINFO)\r\n- fixed endbunny and endgame UMAPINFO fields\r\n- reset mlook on demo recording\r\n- added OpenGL sprite fuzz options (\"darken\", \"shadow\", \"transparent\", \"ghostly\")\r\n- properly check for the CreateFileMapping() symbol (build)\r\n- always precache sound lumps\r\n- replace W_SafeGetNumForName() with W_CheckNumForName()\r\n- removed defunct lump locking warnings\r\n- removed obsolete SFX usefulness references\r\n- allow colored blood to get

complevels\r\n- added the autoload directory feature from Chocolate Doom\r\n- implemented custom atexit() sequence, ported over from Chocolate Doom, fixing crashes during shutdown e.g. on Linux using Wayland\r\n- fixed switching weapons when reaching zero ammo with boom_autoswitch == 0\r\n- made Doom sound quirk fixes available on all complevels\r\n- UMAPINFO: introduced the new 'label' field\r\n- do not cast degenmobj_t as mobj_t, breaks aliasing rules on platforms where mobj_t pointers are 64-bit aligned and\r\ndegenmobj_t pointers are only 32-bit aligned\r\n- fixed `-solo-net` for demo restart\r\n- fixed levelstat crash for MAP33 and above\r\n- added autoload per PWAD feature, further enhancing the autoload directory feature\r\n- UMAPINFO: fixed 'episode' field parsing, 'label' is single-line\r\n- removed obsolete weapon toggle setting\r\n- added ftell() and fseek() implementations for DEHACKED lumps, allowing the DEH parser to roll back to the start of a line following a blank
