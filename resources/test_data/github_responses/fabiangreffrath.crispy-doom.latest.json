It is a bug-fix release fixing a regression in savegame restoring introduced by the A11Y features from the 5.10.2 release.\r\n\r\n**New Features and Improvements**\r\n\r\n * The translucency map is now always recalculated and no more loaded from a file or lump.\r\n * Autoload directories are now also supported for \"sideloaded\" PWADs - i.e. nerve.wad, masterlevels.wad and sigil.wad (thanks @Raddatoons).\r\n\r\n**Bug Fixes**\r\n\r\n * Rendered sector lightlevels are now saved in savegames if they are different from the logical lightlevels, fixing a regression intruduced with A11Y support (thanks Alaux).\r\n * The green color translation range has been fine-tuned so that light-blue isn't preferred over green anymore (thanks maxmanium).\r\n * The CMake build system has been updated for A11Y (thanks @vanfanel).\r\n\r\nCrispy Doom 5.10.3 is based on Chocolate Doom 3.0.1 and has merged all changes to the Chocolate Doom master branch up to commit [`3524a67d`](https://github.com/chocolate-doom/chocolate-doom/commit/3524a67dd3c7d48a172c83d3ae170a7176fb3cfa).",
